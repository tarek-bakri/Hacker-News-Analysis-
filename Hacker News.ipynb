    "#### (Q-2) Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "Further analysis of the Ask posts data revealed that the top 5 hours for Ask posts comments per post varied with time-of-day. The highest number of average comments was 28.68 comments per post made at 3:00 PM and the lowest number of average comments was 10.68 comments per post made at 10:00 AM. \n",
    "Thus, it can be concluded that the number of comments per Ask posts vary throughout the day and we found that the highest level of interactions is in the afternoon period between 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM are likely to attract more comments than posts submitted at other times of the day."
